## Introduction

Developed and maintenced by me since Aug, 2021.

One of the oldest with the [WiriScript](https://github.com/nowiry/WiriScript) in the [Stand](https://stand.gg) Lua Scripts Community.

HC focuses helping play heists in GTA Online, provides some extra options for unlocks and useful tool features for heists.

Originally from [HC for 2T1](https://github.com/jhowkNx/Heist-Control-v2) and [Master Unlocker for 2T1](https://github.com/jhowkNx/Master-Unlocker), I've to use his code. so, this script can be released. You can realize easily that 2T1 HC and Stand HC look like similar, that's why.

Currently try making unique features not exist in 2T1 one, like Auto Cayo Bot.

Note that some options and codes of 2T1 HC and 2T1 Master Unlocker were coded by me to improve it, not only using its code.
- For examples, `Check compatibility with current GTA Online`, [Instant Finish for the Air Cargo](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3513482-post37.html), [Request Services](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3442776-post4.html), `Remove Money via Ballistic Armor`, [Some options of the Mini Game Hack](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/3455828-post8.html).
