# Heist Control (HC) for Stand


## Download

**Download is available in the Repository** of [Stand mod menu](https://stand.gg): `Stand > Lua Scripts > Repository > Heist Control`, will be kept latest version of HC.


## Introduction

Developed and maintenced by me since Aug, 2021.
A Lua Script only completely compatible with [Stand mod menu](https://stand.gg)

Originally from [HC for 2T1](https://github.com/jhowkNx/Heist-Control-v2) and [Master Unlocker for 2T1](https://github.com/jhowkNx/Master-Unlocker), I allowed to use his code. so, this script can be released. You can find a interesting fact that 2T1 HC and Stand HC look like similar, this is why.
But, I've not used all codes of 2T1 HC and Master Unlocker, trying to make unique features not exist in 2T1 one.

HC focuses helping play heists in the GTA:O, provides some extra options for unlocks.
