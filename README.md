## Introduction

Developed and maintenced by me since Aug, 2021.

One of the oldest and never have been discontinued with the [Wiriscript](https://github.com/nowiry/WiriScript) in the Stand Lua Scripts Community.
Only completely compatible with [Stand mod menu](https://stand.gg)

HC focuses helping play heists in the GTA:O, provides some extra options for unlocks and useful tools for heists.

Originally from [HC for 2T1](https://github.com/jhowkNx/Heist-Control-v2) and [Master Unlocker for 2T1](https://github.com/jhowkNx/Master-Unlocker), I allowed to use his code. so, this script can be released. You can realize easily that 2T1 HC and Stand HC look like similar, this is why.

But, I've not used all codes of 2T1 HC and Master Unlocker, trying to make unique features not exist in 2T1 one.

Note that some options and codes of 2T1 HC was coded by me to improve it, not only using its code.
